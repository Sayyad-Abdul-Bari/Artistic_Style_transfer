# Artistic Style Transfer in TensorFlow

This project implements an artistic style transfer algorithm, which merges two images, namely a "content" image and a "style" image, to create a generated image that looks like the content image but painted in the style of the style image.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository demonstrates the entire process of the style transfer, including data preprocessing, the building of the neural network model, the training process, and the evaluation of the results.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the style transfer model on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed along with the following packages:

- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL
